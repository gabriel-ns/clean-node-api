# Clean Node Api

This is a backend project developed using TDD practices and applying Clean Architecture concepts, as a result from
[Mango course in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV1wQ6GFH0A&list=PL9aKtVrF05DyEwK5kdvzrYXFdpZfj1dsG&ab_channel=Mango)

It implements a login api using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and JWT.

My thanks to Rodrigo Manguinho for instructing me in this course!
